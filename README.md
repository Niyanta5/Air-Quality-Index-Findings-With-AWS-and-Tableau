# Unveiling U.S. Air Quality Dynamics through AWS Insights üå¨Ô∏èüìä

## Introduction

Air pollution poses a significant threat to public health, yet readily available data often remains unexplored. By delving into the rich details captured in daily Air Quality System (AQS) summaries, we can move beyond basic understanding and identify actionable insights to inform decision-making. This project aims to address air pollution concerns by uncovering patterns and identifying problematic areas.
Let's explore the air quality data using AWS services and visualize it in Tableau.

## Grain

The grain of the data is at the daily level, where each record in the fact table represents air quality measurements for each parameter at a particular location for one day.

## Dimensions

### Time Dimension ‚è∞

- **Date Local**: The date of the measurements.
- **Day of the Week**: The day of the week corresponding to the date.
- **Month**: The month corresponding to the date.
- **Year**: The year corresponding to the date.

### Location Dimension üåé

- **State Code**: Code representing the state where the measurements were taken.
- **County Code**: Code representing the county where the measurements were taken.
- **Latitude**: Latitude coordinate of the measurement location.
- **Longitude**: Longitude coordinate of the measurement location.
- **State Name**: The name of the state where the measurements were taken.

## Air Quality Fact

Core measurements for each pollutant include:

- **AQI (Air Quality Index)**: An index used to communicate how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecast to become.
- **1st Max Value**: The highest value measured for the pollutant during the day.
- **1st Max Hour**: The hour when the highest value for the pollutant was measured.
- **Arithmetic Mean**: The average value of the pollutant over the day.

# Conclusion üìù

Our analysis of U.S. air quality revealed concerning trends and valuable insights. By leveraging AWS and rigorous data exploration, we identified Arizona as a state with consistently high levels of all measured pollutants (CO, NO2, PM2.5, PM10, and Ozone). Pennsylvania, while appearing in the top 5 for all pollutants, stood out for particularly high PM2.5 levels, likely due to industrial activity.

Seasonal patterns emerged, with pollution peaking in winter (December-February) and dipping in summer (June-August). This likely reflects colder temperatures trapping pollutants in winter, while summer brings warmer air and sunshine that helps disperse them. Notably, the highly concerning PM2.5 remained elevated throughout the year, with a concerning December spike. Specific locations within Arizona (Gila County) and Pennsylvania (Dauphin County) were identified as having the highest overall pollution levels in 2022.

Moving forward, integrating machine learning models and expanding data collection efforts present exciting opportunities for further refinement. Overall, this project underscores the power of data-driven approaches in tackling environmental challenges and informing decisions for a healthier future.
